    <h2>About me</h2>

    <img class="picture" alt="Test picture" src="Images/dog pic 1.jpg">


    <P class="about">I am an ambitious, energetic and outgoing twenty-three year old who grew up and currently resides
        in Oro Valley, a suburb located in northwest Tucson. I enjoy spending my free time working out at the gym,
        playing Overwatch on my ps4, and hanging out by the pool. The reason that I took this coding class because I am
        interested in the field and am looking for a higher paying career, hopefully one day I will be proficient enough
        to create my own program or website. I currently work for local a carpet company in Tucson in there central
        office. Most weekdays after work you kind find me at Expresso Art on university working on my projects for the
        coding class.
